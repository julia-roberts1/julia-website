    Julia Roberts is a North American artist and photographer. Born in the suburbs of Montréal, Julia
    grew up with a large background in arts and theater. As a child she was a member of multiple
    theater groups, spending each season memorizing lines and rehearsing for her next performance. Still passionate about performing, Julia moved towards a less vocal art form and found joy in Dance. At the age of 9 she was given a disposable camera
    to document her dance lessons. On this first roll of film she took a photo of her neighborhood friends that landed her a first prize in a visual art competition in the theme of friendship. This encouraged her to continue exploring the
    juxtaposition of person and placement. Throughout the years Roberts’ tool evolved alongside her approach to the subject matter. She learned how to position and direct her subjects and deliver a story that the viewer can connect to. This practice
    led her to The Professional Photography program at Dawson where she made her first contact with a modeling agency and was taught how to market her work. Throughout the years Roberts has worked with countless modelling agencies from Montreal to
    Paris and has published work in several independent Magazines. She is based in Montréal and Paris.
